        "İstanbul is the largest city of Turkey, with over 15 million residents. It is also, the world's largest fifteenth city. The high population rate is the result of having more economical, cultural and social opportunities than the rest of the country, but this also brings some struggles for residents of the city. One of them is finding an appropriate house. Location of the house is very important for the home seekers, in terms of its nearness to places like public transportation hubs, schools, hospitals, etc.\n",
